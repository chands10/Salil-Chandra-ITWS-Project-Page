This lab contains a website that is password protected and contains the contents of Salil Chandra's labs.
The color schemes rely on a variety of blues, making the website visually appealing.
This site includes a header, a menu, content, and a footer.
The menu has two options: Home and Projects.
The projects menu consists of a dynamic page created using AJAX. Each lab holds links in the form of buttons (jQuery UI elements).
